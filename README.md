# Yelp Analysis
Yelp is an application to provide the platform for customers to write reviews and provide a star-rating. A research indicates that a one-star increase led to 59% increase in revenue of independent restaurants. Therefore, we see great potential of Yelp dataset as a valuable insights repository.

The main focus of this project is to look at the ratings and reviews for restaurant and do sentiment analysis of the reviews, specially Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis. Using user, business and review attributes, we will try to predict ratings and analyze what factors best predict the ratings of review.
